'brico-wilds' is a modular software engine that is designed around the user.
Influenced by unix philosophy it provides a '_brico' (bricoleur) model, a model that encourages hacking
and is designed to allow the user to collage together many small modular elements.

Modules are encouraged to be very diverse, they should present / incorporate / encapsule a particular idea / functionality. 
Writing modules and using them should be trivial, there should be the least amount of resistence possible in creating and using new modules. 
Also users should have complete control over their bricoleur, they should be able to select any database they wish, 
convert/stream their user data in any way they see fit.

The system itself should not attempt to control this behaviour. 
The bricoleur has tools to process and use anything in the _wilds, modules in wilds are mapped and indexed to allow for manipulation. 
The bricoleur exists in two dimensions, on the server and in the browser.

The software api should be inedependant from the gui, and should not be wrapped around or diluted by gui concerns.
Robustness and speed performance is acheived through transparency, designed with the same philosophy as the underlying software.
